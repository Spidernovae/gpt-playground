# Sliding Puzzle App

A simple 15‑puzzle game built with Vue 3 Composition API and TypeScript. The board is a 4×4 grid with 15 tiles and one empty space. Arrange the tiles in order to win.

## Development

```bash
# from repo root
yarn install
cd apps/sliding-puzzle
yarn dev
```

## Future Work

A placeholder `solvePuzzle` function exists in `src/components/PuzzleBoard.vue` where you can implement an algorithm that solves the puzzle.
