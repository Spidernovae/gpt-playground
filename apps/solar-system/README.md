# Solar System 3D

A minimal interactive solar system built with Vue 3, TypeScript and Three.js. It renders a sun and a single orbiting planet using `three.js` with orbit controls so you can rotate and zoom the scene.

## Development

```bash
# from repo root
yarn install
cd apps/solar-system
yarn dev
```
